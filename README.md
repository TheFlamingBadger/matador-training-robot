# Mentador: The Matador Training Robot

**USYD MTRX3700 Major Project**

> Mentador is digital signal processing project exclusively deployed on an FPGA (Intel-Altera Cyclone IV) integrating on-board processing of microphone feed, camera feed, ultrasonic measurements, and infrared remote control to compute control signals sent over UART to a UGV02 six-wheeled robot chassis.
>
> The system has been designed to behave like a bull to provide an ethical alternative for bull-fighter training.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Locks in on red objects and charges toward them
- ‚úÖ Avoid collisions by stopping when forward facing distance is less than the ‚Äùfollow distance‚Äù
- ‚úÖ Stops moving for 10s when a whistle of a specific pitch is heard
- ‚úÖ Resume moving when a clap is heard

**IR Remote Functionality**:
  - Power - Disable charging functionality
  - Play/Pause - Enable charging functionality
  - Channel up - Increase follow distance by 10cm up to a maximum of 100cm
  - Channel down - Decrease follow distance by 10cm down to a minimum of 20cm
  - 1, 2, 3 - Set difficulty level of device which determines how fast it moves (higher difficulty is faster)
  - Mute - Disable ability to issue audio commands
  - Return - Reset the system to default settings

- **Key Algorithms**:
  - **Digital Signal Processing:**
    - `2D Convolution` - Applies a Gaussian kernel to the video feed to reject pixel outliers and improve target detection
    - `Exponential Moving Average Filter` - Stabilises unreliable ultrasonic sensor readings to useable values
    - `Fast Fourier Transform` - Utilisation of hard-IP Discrete Fourier Transform core to transform microphone feed for frequency analysis
    - `Low-Pass Convolution` - Rejects hight-frequency noise from the microphone feed to improve detection of acoustic control inputs
  - **Logic Control:**
    - `Drive Logic FSM` - Implements a Mealy finite state machine to determine system behaviour
    - `UART` - Implements a UART communication soft-IP core also using a Mealy finite state machine

## üß™ Module Simulation

All modules with test-benches (except top-level) can be simulated in Quartus Prime or using [@Verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator) with the following instructions:

1. Navigate to `/VerilogCam_project/modules/<module-you-want-to-test>`
2. Run `./simulate.sh` (or `./simulate_<something>.sh`)
3. Enjoy
